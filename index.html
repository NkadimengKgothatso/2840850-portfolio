                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p> I am a Computer Science student at Wits University ,with a strong passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Coming from a rural background, I’ve embraced the challenge of building my future in the city, driven by determination, resilience, and hard work. My goal is to harness technology not only to create opportunities for myself but also to inspire others from similar beginnings to believe in the power of persistence and innovation.I am a disciple of christ.

                        Project: City Noise Mapper

                        A mobile app that crowdsources audio clips from users and uses AI to classify sounds like traffic, nightlife, or construction. It visualizes noise levels on an interactive city map, helping residents find quieter routes, study spots, or rest times. Built with Python (Librosa + PyTorch), Google Maps API, and React Native, it turns the chaos of urban noise into actionable insights.
